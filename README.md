# EbikeMonitor
The project at hand involves the creation of an innovative ebike monitoring system, aimed at improving the efficiency and safety of electric bicycles. Our primary objective is to develop a proof-of-concept (POC) product that will serve as the foundation for future enhancements and iterations. The system will be seamlessly integrated onto ebikes, providing real-time monitoring and data analysis capabilities to riders and operators alike.
