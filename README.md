# EbikeMonitor

The project at hand involves the creation of an innovative ebike monitoring system, aimed at improving the efficiency and safety of electric bicycles. Our primary objective is to develop a proof-of-concept (POC) product that will serve as the foundation for future enhancements and iterations. The system will be seamlessly integrated onto ebikes, providing real-time monitoring and data analysis capabilities to riders and operators alike.
 # *Components Used*
 Here I intend on tracking location of the bike, speed at which the bike is moving and the batterry status of the bike. 
 Now inorder for me to do that, I will need to implement some components for tracking and measurement.
      1. Esp32 microcontroller
      2. GPS module
      3. GSM module
      4. Display
